# SDL3 Game Engine Framework

This is just a little on-the-side project of mine for potentially making a game with. The code might be a bit wonky here and there cause I'm still in the process of learning C++.

## Requirements

Currently only tested on Linux with the following libraries neccessary to compile it:

- SDL3
- SDL3_image

## Build

To build and run simply run:

> make clean test

## Notice

Currently theres still a lot of stuff to do. The assets for now are temporary and will be replaced soon.
