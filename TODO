- Build out Player class for animation handling // animation handler class?

(- Finish Loader Class for dynamic loading of textures and other assets)

- UI Element class that handles texts and on-screen-elements not affected by the camera?

- Camera class maybe? check if neccessary

- Expand map functionality -> interactions
    -> Probably need some form of state machines for this
